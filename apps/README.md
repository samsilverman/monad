# monad — Applications

This directory contains command-line tools built on top of the `monad` library and demonstrate typical workflows.

> [!NOTE]
> Each application includes a detailed description, usage examples, and parameter explanations in the docstring at the top of its corresponding source file.

## Available Applications

| Application | Description | Gmsh Screenshot |
| - | - | - |
| **`1_2DGrid`** | ***Command-line tool for generating a 2D mesh.*** This program creates a 2D Quad8 grid mesh and saves it to a Gmsh-compatible file. | ![Application 1 screenshot](https://github.com/samsilverman/monad/blob/main/assets/images/1_2DGrid.png) |
| **`2_3DGrid`** | ***Command-line tool for generating a 3D mesh.*** This program creates a 3D Hex8 grid mesh with random densities and saves it to a Gmsh-compatible file. | ![Application 2 screenshot](https://github.com/samsilverman/monad/blob/main/assets/images/2_3DGrid.png) |
| **`3_DensityField`** | ***Command-line tool for generating a density field from a function.*** This program fills the density field of a 32x32x32 Hex8 grid mesh with densities obtained from the continuous function $`f(x,y,z)=\frac{1}{3}\big(\sin^2(10x)+\sin^2(10y)+\sin^2(10z)\big)`$ and saves it to a Gmsh-compatible file. | ![Application 3 screenshot](https://github.com/samsilverman/monad/blob/main/assets/images/3_DensityField.png) |
| **`4_LinearElasticity`** | ***Command-line tool for obtaining the homogenized 2D stiffness tensor for a unit cell.*** This program obtains the homogenized 2D stiffness tensor for a 15x15 Quad8 grid mesh. The following are saved to Gmsh files:<br>1. The density field<br>2. The macroscopic displacements $`\overline{\mathbf{u}}_{11}`$<br>3. The microscopic displacements $`\tilde{\mathbf{u}}_{11}`$<br>4. The total displacements $`\mathbf{u}_{11}=\overline{\mathbf{u}}_{11}+\tilde{\mathbf{u}}_{11}`$ | ![Application 4 screenshot](https://github.com/samsilverman/monad/blob/main/assets/images/4_LinearElasticity.png) |
| **`5_LinearDielectric`** | ***Command-line tool for obtaining the homogenized 2D permittivity tensor for a unit cell.*** This program obtains the homogenized 2D permittivity tensor for a 15x15 Quad8 grid mesh. The following are saved to Gmsh files:<br>1. The density field<br>2. The macroscopic electric potentials $`\overline{\phi}_{11}`$<br>3. The microscopic electric potentials $`\tilde{\phi}_{11}`$<br>4. The total electric potentials $`\phi_{11}=\overline{\phi}_{11}+\tilde{\phi}_{11}`$ | ![Application 5 screenshot](https://github.com/samsilverman/monad/blob/main/assets/images/5_LinearDielectric.png) |
| **`6_LinearPiezoelectricity`** | ***Command-line tool for obtaining the homogenized 2D stiffness, permittivity, and piezoelectric tensors for a unit cell.*** This program obtains the homogenized 2d stiffness, permittivity, and piezoelectric tensors for a 15x15 Quad8 grid mesh. The following are saved to Gmsh files:<br>1. The density field<br>2. The macroscopic displacements $`\overline{\mathbf{u}}_{11}`$<br>3. The microscopic displacements $`\tilde{\mathbf{u}}_{11}`$<br>4. The total displacements $`\mathbf{u}_{11}=\overline{\mathbf{u}}_{11}+\tilde{\mathbf{u}}_{11}`$<br>5. The macroscopic electric potentials $`\overline{\phi}_{11}`$<br>6. The microscopic electric potentials $`\tilde{\phi}_{11}`$<br>7. The total electric potentials $`\phi_{11}=\overline{\phi}_{11}+\tilde{\phi}_{11}`$ | ![Application 6 screenshot](https://github.com/samsilverman/monad/blob/main/assets/images/6_LinearPiezoelectricity.png) |
